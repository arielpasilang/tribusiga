                <p>
                  Tribu Siga Mountaineers was formed by various people who have
                  the hunger and love to challenge themselves outdoors. We stand
                  by our group's values: Camaraderie/Solidarity, Respect, Leave
                  no trace and Humility. Any person who possess these were
                  welcomed and are welcome to join our group of venturesomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  "Siga ang ilong ug mata" a Cebuano term that was derived from
                  experiencing the mountain itself- nose wide open to catch air
                  while trekking, and eyes broadly open to witness the beauty of
                  nature.
                </p>

                  The mountaineering group names were "Tribu Pabebe" and "Tribu
                  Kaplag" before we finally called ourselves "Tribu Siga".
                  Initially, before Tribu Siga was born, we joined our friends
                  from Tribu Dumagsa during their hikes and camps in Challet
                  hills, Sirao peak, Mt. Naupa, Camari hills, Osme√±a peak,
                  Kandungaw peak and Bocaue peak that are situated in Cebu
                  Province, our home.
