                  Unawarely, most of the members of tribu siga are a fan of{" "}
                  <i>LOG HORIZON.</i> It means that we enjoy witnessing the
                  twilight sunrise over the horizon together in which we
                  record(log) it in our memories.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believe that, it's a rare pportunity to watch the sunrise
                  and sunset above the mountains high. Trust me, the feelings
                  are priceless.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you love hiking and watching sunrise, come and contact
                  Tribu Siga Mountaineers and let's do LOG HORIZON together.
